<h1>Miwok App</h1>
<p>This app displays lists of vocabulary words for the user to learn the Miwok language. 
Used in a Udacity course in the Beginning Android Nanodegree. I have added a little more functionality to it
like animations and transitions.</p>

<h2> Prequisites </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Android SDK v23</li>
  <li>Android Build Tools v23.0.2</li>
  <li>Android Support Repository v23.3.0</li>
</ul>

<h2> Getting started </h2>
<p>This sample uses the Gradle build system. 
To build this project, use the "gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio. 
If your gradle version is mismatched then you need to update your gradle version accordingly.
Some libraries used in the project might have become obselete. So, Update them if required.<p>
